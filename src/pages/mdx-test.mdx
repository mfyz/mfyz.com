# MDX Styling Test Page

## Table of Contents

This page demonstrates the custom styling of all markdown elements using our MDXComponents. Each element has been styled to match our site's design system, with proper typography, spacing, and color schemes for both light and dark modes.

## Typography Elements

Paragraphs like this one use proper text styling with balanced line height and spacing. You can include **bold text** for emphasis or *italic text* for distinction. You can also use ***bold and italic*** together when needed.

### Lists

Unordered lists are styled with proper bullets and spacing:

- First item in the list
- Second item with some **bold text**
- Third item containing a [link to mfyz.com](https://mfyz.com)
- Fourth item with some `inline code`

Ordered lists have proper numbering and consistent styling:

1. First ordered item
2. Second ordered item
3. Third ordered item with *italic text*
4. Fourth ordered item

#### Code Blocks

Inline code like `const greeting = "Hello, world!";` is styled with a distinctive background.

Code blocks have syntax highlighting and proper spacing:

```javascript
function testFunction() {
  // This is a comment
  const message = "Hello from MDX styling!";
  console.log(message);
  return true;
}

// Call the function
testFunction();
```

##### Blockquotes

Blockquotes are styled with a distinctive left border and italic text:

> This is a blockquote to demonstrate the styling. It has a subtle left border and proper spacing to distinguish it from regular paragraphs.
>
> You can have multiple paragraphs within a blockquote, and they maintain consistent styling.

###### Tables

Tables have clean borders and alternating row colors for better readability:

| Name | Role | Department |
|------|------|------------|
| John Smith | Developer | Engineering |
| Jane Doe | Designer | Design |
| Bob Johnson | Manager | Operations |
| Alice Brown | Director | Executive |

# About this website

mfyz.com has been my online home since 2003. What started as a small playground for a curious web developer grew into a space where I share experiments, lessons, and reflections from two decades of working in tech.

Over the years, this site has gone through nine full redesigns and rewrites, evolving alongside the technologies I was exploringâ€”back-end, front-end, product design, cloud, and everything in between. At different times it has hosted tutorials, code snippets, a developer community, and my thoughts on work and life.

Today, mfyz.com is simply what it always wanted to be: a personal blog. A place where I write about my interests, my experiments, and the things Iâ€™m learning as both a technologist and a human.

## About Fatih YÄ±ldÄ±z

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Fatih YÄ±ldÄ±z, a technologist, product thinker, and lifelong builder. Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the years: back-end engineer, front-end developer, product manager, team lead, and founder.

Currently, I work as a Technical Product Manager at The Washington Post, where I help shape the tools and platforms powering modern digital publishing.

Beyond my day job, I love experimenting with new technologies, exploring the future of the web, and writing about the lessons I pick up along the way. I also occasionally dive into lifestyle topics, like remote work, digital nomadism, or the challenges of balancing tech life with parenthood.

# I moved my blog from WordPress to Astro

After years of running my personal site on WordPress, I decided it was time for a change. WordPress served me well, but as a developer focused on modern web technologies, I wanted something that better aligned with my values and workflow.

This post documents my journey migrating from WordPress to Astro - the decision process, challenges, and lessons learned. For a detailed analysis of the performance comparison between the two versions, check out my follow-up post: [From WordPress to Astro: A Performance Comparison](/wordpress-to-astro-migration-performance-comparison/).

## Why I Decided to Move Away from WordPress

WordPress powers over 40% of the web for good reasons: it's flexible, has a massive ecosystem, and lets non-technical users publish content easily. For my personal site, however, I started feeling constrained by:

- **Development workflow**: As a developer, I wanted a more code-centric workflow with version control
- **Modern tech stack**: I was eager to use modern JavaScript, component-driven development, and a more flexible rendering approach
- **Control and customization**: WordPress's plugin ecosystem is great but often leads to bloat and maintenance overhead
- **Content authoring**: I wanted to write in Markdown/MDX and handle content as files rather than database entries

After evaluating several modern frameworks, I landed on [Astro](https://astro.build) for its focus on content-first websites, component flexibility, and emphasis on shipping minimal JavaScript.

## Migration Strategy

My migration approach involved:

1. Exporting all WordPress content to Markdown
2. Setting up an Astro project with similar design and information architecture
3. Carefully migrating key functionality (comments, search, etc.)
4. Building a CI/CD pipeline for easy updates
5. Setting up redirects to maintain SEO

While time-consuming, this methodical approach helped ensure a smooth transition.

## Key Benefits Beyond Performance

The migration brought numerous benefits beyond just performance:

- **Better developer experience**: Git-based workflow, component-driven architecture
- **Lower hosting costs**: Static hosting is significantly cheaper than WordPress hosting
- **Improved security**: Smaller attack surface with no PHP or database
- **Content ownership**: All content as Markdown in a Git repository
- **Customization freedom**: Full control over the codebase without plugin limitations

## Challenges and Solutions

The migration wasn't without challenges:

Replacing WordPress plugins required finding alternative solutions:
- **Comments**: Replaced with GitHub Discussions
- **Forms**: Implemented with a serverless function
- **Search**: Added static search with Pagefind
</CollapsibleText>

Some content required manual fixing:
- Custom shortcodes needed conversion to Astro components
- Embedded content needed special handling
- Image paths and metadata needed updating
</CollapsibleText>

<CollapsibleText title="SEO considerations">
Ensuring SEO continuity required:
- Mapping all old URLs to new ones
- Setting up proper redirects
- Verifying structured data implementation
- Resubmitting sitemaps
</CollapsibleText>

## Technical Implementation Details

The new stack includes:

- **Astro**: Core framework
- **MDX**: For rich content with components
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling
- **Vercel**: For hosting and serverless functions
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD

The repository is structured as a monorepo, making it easy to manage both the site and supporting tools in one place.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons from this migration:

1. **Start with content export**: Getting clean content from WordPress first makes everything easier
2. **Tackle one section at a time**: Breaking the migration into smaller chunks keeps it manageable
3. **Plan for redirects early**: Map out your URL strategy before finalizing the new site structure
4. **Automate what you can**: Scripts for content migration save countless hours of manual work
5. **Test extensively**: Check the site on multiple devices and browsers before switching over

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. While WordPress is an excellent platform for many use cases, this more developer-centric approach has significantly improved my content workflow, site maintainability, and overall development satisfaction.

The ability to use modern web development practices, version control my entire site (content and code), and deploy with confidence has transformed my relationship with my personal website.

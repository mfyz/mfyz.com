Sometimes you donâ€™t need a full-blown app. You just need one endpoint. Maybe itâ€™s for a tool youâ€™re building. Maybe itâ€™s a prototype. Or maybe, itâ€™s just for the vibes. Fastify + Vercel is a great combo for that.

Letâ€™s walk through how you can build and deploy a `/books` API endpoint using Fastify and Drizzle ORM â€” and how surprisingly easy it is.

## Why Vercel for an API?

You probably know Vercel as the go-to place for frontend apps, especially Next.js. But it also works beautifully for backend use cases, like single endpoint APIs.

Hereâ€™s why:

*   **Zero-config deploys**

*   **Built-in scalability**

*   **Serverless by default**

*   **Free tier good enough for small APIs**

*   **Instant previews for each commit**

That means your idea can go from local to live in minutes.

## Letâ€™s Build `/books`Â CRUD

In this example, weâ€™ll build a RESTful CRUD endpoint for managing books. Weâ€™ll use Fastify as the HTTP framework, and Drizzle as the ORM to talk to a database. You can swap Drizzle with anything else (Prisma, Kysely, raw SQL), but for this demo, weâ€™ll show Drizzle in the code.

### File: `api/books.ts`

```
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/vercel-postgres';
import { sql } from '@vercel/postgres';
import { FastifyRequest, FastifyReply } from 'fastify';
import Fastify from 'fastify';

const db = drizzle(sql);

const fastify = Fastify();

fastify.get('/books', async (req: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
  const books = await db.query.books.findMany();
  return reply.send(books);
});

fastify.post('/books', async (req: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
  const body = req.body as { title: string; author: string };
  const inserted = await db.insertInto('books').values(body).returning();
  return reply.code(201).send(inserted);
});

fastify.put('/books/:id', async (req: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
  const { id } = req.params as { id: string };
  const body = req.body as { title?: string; author?: string };
  const updated = await db.update('books').set(body).where({ id }).returning();
  return reply.send(updated);
});

fastify.delete('/books/:id', async (req: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
  const { id } = req.params as { id: string };
  await db.deleteFrom('books').where({ id });
  return reply.code(204).send();
});

export default fastify;

```

This file is all you need. Put it under the `api/` folder in a Vercel project. Vercel will automatically treat it as a serverless function.

### Deploy it

```
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel

```

Thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™ll get a working API endpoint at something like:

```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/books

```

* * *

## Test It with `curl`

Hereâ€™s how to add a book:

```
curl -X POST <https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/books> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andy Hunt"}'

```

Youâ€™ll get a `201 Created` with the new book entry.

## Popular Fastify Plugins

Fastify has a rich plugin ecosystem. Some handy ones to know:

*   [`@fastify/swagger`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-swagger) â€“ Auto-generate OpenAPI docs

*   [`@fastify/rate-limit`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit) â€“ Protect endpoints from abuse

*   [`@fastify/jwt`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-jwt) â€“ Simple JWT authentication

*   [`@fastify/cors`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cors) â€“ Easy CORS handling

Adding them is just a few lines of code. Thatâ€™s part of the joy of Fastify.

## Best Vibes

Fastify on Vercel is perfect for AI-generated APIs. When tools or agents generate code for your backend, you want:

*   Fast iteration

*   Clear docs

*   Built-in tests

*   Easy deploys

This combo checks all those boxes. Itâ€™s low friction, flexible, and fun to build with. You can write code manually or have AI generate itâ€”and either way, it just works.

When you want to build fast and iterate even faster, this is a stack worth reaching for.

Thatâ€™s it. One file, fully working CRUD API, deployable in under 2 minutes. Enjoy the vibes ðŸ§ƒ

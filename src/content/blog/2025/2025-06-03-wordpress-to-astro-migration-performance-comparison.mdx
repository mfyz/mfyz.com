Recently, [I migrated my blog from WordPress to Astro](/moved-blog-from-wordpress-to-astro/), looking for improvements in developer experience, content workflow, and performance. While my primary motivations weren't purely performance-related (as detailed in my previous post), I was certainly curious how the two platforms would compare.

This post focuses exclusively on the performance comparison between my WordPress site and the new Astro version. Using Lighthouse and real-world metrics, I'll analyze the performance differences, share unexpected findings, and what we can learn from them.

## Performance Comparison: WordPress vs. Astro

Before pushing the new site live, I ran comprehensive performance tests comparing the WordPress site with the Astro version. Here's what I found:

<CollapsibleText title="How the benchmark was conducted">
I created a Node.js script using Lighthouse to test both the live WordPress site and local Astro development site. The script:

1. Tests the homepage and 10 randomly selected blog posts
2. Runs Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO
3. Captures Core Web Vitals metrics like LCP, FID, and CLS
4. Generates a CSV report with the comparison data

All tests were run with the same network and device conditions to ensure a fair comparison.

### Key Performance Findings

After running comprehensive Lighthouse tests on both the WordPress and Astro versions of the site, here are the actual performance results:

#### Overall Average Scores

| Metric | WordPress | Astro | Difference |
|--------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Performance Score | 99.5 | 99.5 | No change |
| Accessibility | 99.0 | 91.9 | -7.1 points |
| Best Practices | 99.3 | 100.0 | +0.7 points |
| SEO | 85.9 | 100.0 | +14.1 points |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 0.69s | 0.45s | -0.24s (faster) |
| First Input Delay (FID) | 16ms | 16ms | No change |
| Time To First Byte (TTFB) | 76.6ms | 79.8ms | +3.2ms (slower) |
| HTML Size | 38.7KB | 10.9KB | -27.8KB (71.8% smaller) |
| JavaScript Size | 13.4KB | 5.3KB | -8.1KB (60.4% smaller) |
| CSS Size | 68.1KB | 6.5KB | -61.6KB (90.5% smaller) |

#### Performance Analysis

The results revealed some interesting insights. Both sites performed exceptionally well in core performance metrics, with both versions achieving excellent scores in the Lighthouse performance category. Let's break down what these numbers mean:

- **Performance**: Both sites scored identically well, with WordPress and Astro both at 99.5. Both scores are in the "Good" range (90-100), indicating excellent performance. This tie was surprising, as static site generators are often assumed to outperform CMS platforms.

- **Accessibility**: WordPress scored higher with 99.0 vs Astro's 91.9. This suggests there are some accessibility improvements needed in the Astro implementation, though both are still in the "Good" range. These differences likely stem from implementation choices rather than inherent platform limitations.

- **Best Practices**: Astro slightly outperformed WordPress with a perfect 100.0 vs WordPress's 99.3. Both are in the "Good" range, but Astro demonstrates slightly better adherence to web best practices.

- **SEO**: Astro significantly outperformed WordPress with a perfect 100 score compared to WordPress's 85.9. This is one of the clearest advantages of the Astro implementation and represents a substantial improvement.

- **Core Web Vitals and Speed Metrics**: Both sites performed exceptionally well in these critical metrics, but with some notable differences:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): Astro averaged 0.45s compared to WordPress's 0.69s, a 35% improvement and well under the 2.5s "Good" threshold
  - FID (First Input Delay): Both at 16ms, well under the 100ms "Good" threshold
  - TTFB (Time To First Byte): WordPress was slightly faster at 76.6ms vs Astro's 79.8ms

- **Resource Size**: The most dramatic differences were in resource sizes:
  - HTML: Astro's HTML was 71.8% smaller (10.9KB vs 38.7KB)
  - JavaScript: Astro used 60.4% less JavaScript (5.3KB vs 13.4KB)
  - CSS: Astro used 90.5% less CSS (6.5KB vs 68.1KB)

#### Page-by-Page Performance

Here's a detailed breakdown of performance scores for each tested page:

| Page | WP Performance | Astro Performance | WP LCP (s) | Astro LCP (s) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Homepage | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.76 | 0.31 |
| n8n workflows | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.38 | 0.27 |
| XMLHTTPRequest | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.74 | 0.34 |
| n8n form trigger | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.33 | 0.27 |
| Fastify + Vercel | 99.0 | 99.0 | 0.98 | 0.50 |
| Automate with n8n | 98.0 | 100.0 | 0.97 | 0.25 |
| Scale at Arc XP | 99.0 | 100.0 | 0.89 | 0.41 |
| turso + drizzle | 99.0 | 97.0 | 0.90 | 1.10 |
| kokorojs | 99.0 | 98.0 | 0.88 | 0.90 |
| About | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.40 | 0.28 |
| License | 100.0 | 100.0 | 0.36 | 0.26 |

#### Performance by Content Type

Interestingly, certain content types showed specific patterns:

- **Simple pages** (About, License): The Astro version had faster LCP times (0.28s vs 0.40s for About; 0.26s vs 0.36s for License)
- **Code-heavy blog posts**: Astro generally outperformed WordPress (0.34s vs 0.74s for XMLHTTPRequest post)
- **Image-heavy posts**: Most posts performed better in Astro, but some posts like the turso+drizzle post (1.10s vs 0.90s LCP) and kokorojs post (0.90s vs 0.88s LCP) performed slightly better in WordPress

## Testing Methodology

<CollapsibleText title="How the benchmark was conducted">
I created a Node.js script using Lighthouse to test both versions of my site:

1. The live WordPress site at mfyz.com  
2. The Astro version deployed to Vercel (It wasn't live yet, but I would simply put Cloudflare in front of it when I push it live)

The script:
- Tests the homepage and 10 random blog posts (blog posts, static pages)
- Runs Lighthouse audits for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO
- Captures Core Web Vitals metrics like LCP and FID
- Generates a CSV report with the comparison data

All tests were run with identical network and device conditions using desktop settings.
</CollapsibleText>

I selected a diverse set of pages to test, including:

- The homepage
- Blog posts with various content types (text-heavy, code-heavy, image-heavy)
- Static pages (About, License)

## What These Results Mean

The performance results provide a nuanced view of how static site generators compare to well-optimized WordPress sites. Some key insights:

### Highly Optimized WordPress

It's worth emphasizing that my WordPress site was heavily statically cached at multiple levels:

- **WP Rocket**: Server-side caching plugin generating static HTML files
- **Cloudflare Edge Caching**: 1-week TTL at the CDN level

This means that during these tests, no actual PHP rendering was happening on the WordPress site. We're definitely looking at a highly optimized WordPress installation in this benchmark, which explains why the Lighthouse performance scores are identical in many cases.

1. **WordPress can be fast with proper optimization**: My WordPress site was already highly optimized with a lightweight theme, minimal plugins, and good hosting. The identical performance scores (99.5 for both) demonstrate this clearly.

2. **Content type matters**: Simple pages and most content types showed consistent improvements in Astro, with a few exceptions for certain image-heavy posts.

3. **Trade-offs exist**: The Astro version scored lower on accessibility, which likely relates to implementation details rather than the framework itself.

4. **SEO improvements are significant**: The perfect 100 SEO scores across all Astro pages represent a meaningful improvement from WordPress's 85.9 average.

5. **Resource efficiency is dramatically better in Astro**: The most striking differences were in resource sizes, with Astro using 71.8% less HTML, 60.4% less JavaScript, and 90.5% less CSS.

## Technical Implementation Notes

For those interested in the technical aspects of the Astro implementation:

- **Built with**: Astro, MDX for content, TailwindCSS for styling
- **Hosting**: Vercel with static site generation
- **Components**: Mix of Astro and React components
- **Images**: Optimized with Astro's built-in image optimization
- **Performance features**: Route pre-fetching, deferred hydration, CSS optimization

## Conclusion

Migrating from WordPress to Astro has transformed my content workflow and delivered notable performance improvements, particularly in resource efficiency and loading speed. My WordPress site was already extremely well-optimized, which explains why both implementations achieved identical Lighthouse performance scores (99.5).

The key findings from this migration:

1. **Performance isn't just about the framework**: A well-optimized WordPress site can match a static site in core Lighthouse performance metrics
2. **LCP improvements are significant**: Astro delivered a 35% faster Largest Contentful Paint on average (0.45s vs 0.69s)
3. **Resource efficiency is dramatically better**: Astro used 71.8% less HTML, 60.4% less JavaScript, and 90.5% less CSS
4. **SEO improvements**: The most significant advantage was in SEO scores, where Astro consistently achieved perfect scores compared to WordPress's 85.9 average
5. **Content-dependent results**: Nearly all page types showed LCP improvements in Astro, with only a couple of image-heavy exceptions

In the coming weeks, I'll share more detailed posts about specific aspects of the migration, including:

1. Content migration techniques
2. Component design decisions
3. Performance optimization strategies
4. SEO maintenance during framework migration

Let me know if you're considering a similar migration—I'm happy to share more specific insights about the process!

I'm excited to announce two significant updates to mfyz.com!

## mfyz.com is Now Open Source! ðŸš€

Believing strongly in the open-source ecosystem, I've made the Astro codebase for mfyz.com publicly available. I'm hoping this will allow for transparency, learning, and community collaboration.

Explore the code on GitHub: [mfyz/mfyz.com](https://github.com/mfyz/mfyz.com)

## New: Reactions and Comments with Giscus ðŸ’¬

Blog posts now feature reactions and a new commenting system powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). Giscus is an open-source solution that uses GitHub Discussions, allowing you to easily share thoughts and engage with content using your GitHub account.

You'll find the discussion section, including for this very post, at the bottom of each article.

I hope you find these updates valuable. Dive into the repository or share your thoughts in the comments below!

When building tools or workflows, sometimes all you need is a simple form. You want to collect some data, maybe trigger an email, or store it somewhere. Nothing too fancy.

n8n now has a **Form node** that solves this need in the cleanest way possible: it lets you build and host forms directly inside your workflow—no frontend code, no extra tools.

Let me walk you through what it is, why it’s useful, and how to use it with Docker.

### Why Not Use Google Forms, Typeform, etc?

You can always reach for Google Forms, Typeform, or similar tools. They’re simple and easy to use. But the moment you want to automate what happens after a submission—send a Slack message, call an API, store the data in your DB—you’ll hit limitations.

You’d need extra tools or integrations to make things work.

With n8n’s Form node:

*   The form and logic live in the same workflow

*   You don’t need webhooks or third-party automation platforms

*   You keep your data private (self-hosted)

*   You get full flexibility—send emails, update spreadsheets, trigger scripts, whatever you want

**If you're already using n8n, look nowhere else.** This is the simplest and most powerful way to collect data and do something with it.

### New to n8n?

If you haven’t used it before, [n8n](https://n8n.io/) is an open-source workflow automation tool. You build workflows by connecting blocks—kind of like Zapier, but with full control and self-hosting support. I also covered this short intro to n8n in **my previous post**.

You can connect APIs, run scripts, automate tasks, and now—host forms.

### Running n8n with Docker (or Cloud)

n8n has a cloud-hosted version if you want a managed solution.

But I self-host mine. If you're like me and want to run it locally or on your server, here's the quickest way using Docker:

```
docker run -it --rm \\
  -p 5678:5678 \\
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \\
  n8nio/n8n

```

This will launch the n8n editor at: [](http://localhost:5678/)[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

### How to Create a Form-Based Workflow

Let’s create a simple form that collects name and email, and sends a confirmation email.

1.  **Create a New Workflow** Open the n8n editor and click “New Workflow.”

3.  **Add a Form Node**
    *   Search for “Form” and add it.
    
    *   Set title and description.
    
    *   Add fields like:
        *   `Name` (text)
        
        *   `Email` (email)
    
    *   Save the node. It will give you a public form URL.

5.  **Add Next Steps** After the Form node, connect whatever you want:
    *   Email node (send confirmation)
    
    *   Google Sheets node (log submission)
    
    *   HTTP node (send data to an API)
    
    *   Any other of the 200+ integrations

7.  **Activate the Workflow** Save and activate the workflow so the form becomes live.

Now, share the form link and start collecting data. Every submission will go through your automation steps.

### Use Case Ideas

*   **Internal forms**: collect input from your team (ideas, feedback, etc.)

*   **Mini surveys**: run a quick form for user research

*   **Beta signup**: collect early access signups and auto-reply

*   **Manual triggers**: trigger dev/test workflows with custom input

*   **AI workflows** (highlighted): Forms are a great entry point for AI-powered workflows. You can collect user input and feed it into large language models, prompt chains, or API calls. n8n also has built-in **AI and agentic nodes**, which makes it easy to build GPT-style workflows without writing glue code.

### Form node is another way n8n makes things really low-effort

The Form node is a small but powerful feature. You don’t need to manage your own frontend or use a third-party tool. It’s perfect for quick workflows where you want to collect input and immediately act on it.

You can learn more at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/), or just spin it up locally with Docker and try it out.

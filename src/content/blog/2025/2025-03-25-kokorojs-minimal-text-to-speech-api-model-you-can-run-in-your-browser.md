Did you know AI models now run in your browser? One of the most useful examples is [Kokoro.js](https://huggingface.co/posts/Xenova/503648859052804), a lightweight text-to-speech API that makes it super easy to generate spoken audio from text. Whether you're a developer building an interactive web app or just experimenting with text-to-speech, Kokoro.js offers a simple and efficient way to bring voice functionality to your projects.

### What is Kokoro.js?

Kokoro.js is a minimalistic JavaScript library that enables text-to-speech synthesis directly in the browser. Unlike many other TTS solutions that require server-side processing, Kokoro.js runs entirely on the client side, making it faster and more accessible for various applications.

### Why Use Kokoro.js?

Here are some great reasons to use Kokoro.js in your projects:

- **Easy to Use**: The API is straightforward and requires minimal setup.
- **Browser-Based**: No need for server-side infrastructure; everything runs on the client.
- **Fast Performance**: Generate real-time audio with minimal latency.
- **Customizable Voices**: Select different voice styles and modulations.
- **Open Source**: Modify and extend it based on your needs.

### Getting Started

### Installation

To install Kokoro.js, simply run:

```sh
npm install kokoro-js

```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to convert text to speech using Kokoro.js:

```js
import { KokoroTTS } from "kokoro-js";

const tts = await KokoroTTS.from_pretrained(
  "onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-ONNX",
  { dtype: "q8" } // Data type options: fp32, fp16, q8, q4, q4f16
);

const text =
  "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.";
const audio = await tts.generate(text, { voice: "af_sky" });
audio.save("audio.wav");
```

### Try It Online

You can test Kokoro.js without installing anything by trying it online at [Hugging Face’s space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/kokoro-web). Just enter some text and listen to the generated speech.

### How It Works

Kokoro.js operates with a simple four-step process:

1.  **Input Text**: Provide the text you want to convert.
2.  **Select a Voice**: Choose from multiple voices (`tts.list_voices()` lists available options).
3.  **Generate Audio**: The TTS model processes the text into speech.
4.  **Output**: Play or save the generated audio file.

### Potential Use Cases

Kokoro.js can be useful for many applications, such as:

- **Accessibility Features**: Assisting visually impaired users with spoken content.
- **E-Learning Platforms**: Enhancing educational tools with voice support.
- **Storytelling & Audiobooks**: Adding narration to text-based content.
- **Voice Assistants**: Building interactive AI-driven assistants.

### Final Thoughts

With audio content becoming more prevalent, Kokoro.js is a great tool for integrating text-to-speech functionality into your web applications. It's simple, efficient, and open-source—perfect for developers looking for a hassle-free TTS solution.

Give it a try and see how it fits into your projects! You might be surprised at the creative ways you can use it. For more details, check out the [Kokoro.js project page](https://huggingface.co/posts/Xenova/503648859052804). Happy coding!

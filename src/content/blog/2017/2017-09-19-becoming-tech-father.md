I've recently had twin girls and I've been in the process to become a parent. Have been reading and following tons about what to expect in pregnancy as well as rising a child. Obviously, one of the active conversations everybody is having in many different aspects is; how technology affects a child's development. My opinion is, there is a lot goes into how technology affects a person's education depending on how kids are exposed to the technology itself. Since my babies are very small and won't have the difference to have or not have technological additions to their life for a while, I'm thinking how I would use tech as a tool in my parenting. I've been adjusting my lifestyle and adapting my tech skills to taking care of my new babies. One of the things I've been reading was how engineer/developer dads approach to many different aspects of technologically enhancing their early parenting experiences. Most of these are obviously about optimizing the process of nursing babies, getting an early education with technological products.

#### New entrepreneurs are born with kids

(Not the kids that born but the parents becoming entrepreneurs) Often we see a lot of new ideas and products come out of these raising-child struggles and ideas around improving ancient methods of childcare. We see many fun examples of them in Shark Thank :) I really enjoy watching a lot of tech-dads or tech-moms seeing an inefficiency in the process and come up with a new way of doing this never changing life cycle of humankind. I totally get why childcare ignites entrepreneurial mindset. Every human being born the same way, raised same way at least it's very similar despite the cultural differences at least early on in their life. This creates an amazingly similar pattern to be worked with for an entrepreneurial thinking. And best, most parents repeat this cycle multiple times.

#### A new area to geek on for tech-parents

Not all the custom-made solutions make its way to being a new product or service. Most often, you see these small iterations shared conventionally. With the internet, now these conventional wisdom is out there in blogs (like this one). And many parents are sharing their experiences, how they overcome certain obstacles or struggles in their parenting journey. This is particularly convenient for tech-parents. I'm sure I'll be participating on this like others. In fact, I already made experiments with some hardware to enhance my fresh baby-care journey. What this means in the internet, software world is pretty much a lot of new apps and some hardware supported software or services. Since geeking on this is essential, I will be sharing my experiences soon (within the tech-related topics).

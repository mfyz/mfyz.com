When working on a javascript application (i.e: a react app), you probably work with webpack. Your local development setup will most likely be watching changes on your files and doing repeat builds throughout the development process.

Itâ€™s important to get used to webpack output. Being able to pick up important details from it. Webpack output is not particularly difficult but there is a cleaner, more organized way, using webpack-dashboard.

Webpack-dashboard is an interactive command line output that gives you the summary and important stuff you need to see about your build quickly.

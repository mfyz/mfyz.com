  Found a CSS framework that made me question CSS framework bloat.

  Pico CSS: 12KB gzipped, no build process, styles semantic HTML by default. <article> becomes a card. <button> just works.

  Like reset.css on steroids. For small projects, I'm not reaching for Tailwind anymore.

I want to talk about a CSS framework that made me question CSS framework bloat. It's called [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), and it takes a completely different approach to styling web pages.

You know how Tailwind works. You write something like `<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">`. Twenty classes for a button. And you need a build process to purge unused styles, otherwise you're shipping megabytes of CSS.

Pico takes the opposite approach. You write `<button>Click me</button>` and it just looks good. That's it. No classes needed.

## What Makes Pico Different

Pico CSS is essentially reset.css on steroids. It styles native semantic HTML elements so your markup stays clean. An `<article>` renders as a card. A `<pre>` renders as a proper code block. Forms look polished without adding a single class.

The framework uses fewer than 10 CSS classes total. There's even a completely class-less version for HTML purists.

Here's a quick comparison. This is a typical form in a utility-first framework:

```html
<div class="mx-auto max-w-md overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-white shadow-md">
  <div class="p-8">
    <form class="space-y-6">
      <div>
        <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Email</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          class="mt-1 block w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500"
        />
      </div>
      <button
        class="flex w-full justify-center rounded-md border border-transparent bg-indigo-600 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-indigo-700"
      >
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  </div>
</div>
```

Same form with Pico:

```html
<article>
  <form>
    <label
      >Email
      <input type="email" />
    </label>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
</article>
```

Both produce a styled card with a form inside. But one is readable HTML and the other is class soup.

## Size and Performance

Pico comes in at around **12 KB gzipped** (83KB uncompressed). Still way smaller than Bootstrap's 150+ KB. For small projects, landing pages, or documentation sites, this difference matters.

No build process required. You can drop a single `<link>` tag in your HTML and you're done:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css"
/>
```

Or install via npm if you prefer:

```bash
npm install @picocss/pico
```

## Built-in Dark Mode

Dark mode works out of the box. Pico automatically respects the user's `prefers-color-scheme` preference. You can also toggle manually with a data attribute:

```html
<html data-theme="dark"></html>
```

No JavaScript required. No extra CSS files. It just works.

## When to Use Pico

Pico shines for documentation sites, landing pages, internal tools, prototypes, and side projects. Basically anything where you want decent styling without fighting CSS.

It's not ideal for highly custom designs or large applications with complex component libraries. The tradeoff is speed and simplicity versus granular control.

If you need to tweak things, Pico provides over 130 CSS variables and 20 pre-built color themes:

```css
:root {
  --pico-primary: #e91e63;
}
```

## My Take

I've been reaching for Pico on smaller projects lately. For prototypes, documentation, or anything where I just want decent styling without thinking too hard, it's been a breath of fresh air.

For complex UIs, I'll stick with Tailwind. But for everything else? Pico is now my default. Sometimes simpler really is better.

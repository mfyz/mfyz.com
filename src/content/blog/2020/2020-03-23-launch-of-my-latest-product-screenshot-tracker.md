🚨 I've just launched a new product (also in 😸 [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/screenshot-tracker)): 📸 Screenshot Tracker, a desktop all that helps capture full web page screenshots in different resolutions at once.

![](/images/archive/en/2020/03/ScreenshotTrackerPromo.gif)

Screenshot Tracker helps you to collect:

- 🖼 Full-size screenshots for your web pages
- 🎳 Multiple URLs at once
- 📱 In multiple resolutions (desktop, tablet portrait, landscape, and mobile)
- 🔁 Repeat/Retake screenshots

with one click!

Screenshot Tracker is great for designers and developers to test their work while iterating on a web page design and development.

And it's 100% free & open source. PRs welcome!

Itâ€™s very important to keep a changelog and be disciplined about maintaining it as your product progresses. This applies to both product management and software development/management processes.  
  
I want to mention a great source that talks, describe and almost accepted as a standard in open source community for changelogs:

### What is a changelog?

A changelog is a file that contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.  

### Why keep a changelog?

To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.  

### Who needs a changelog?

People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end-users of software are human beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.  

### An example Changelog (from Stretchly)

Github renders this markdown changelog beautifully: [https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/hovancik/stretchly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

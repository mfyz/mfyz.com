## What does it do?

Come Back Reminder helps you recover traffic and sales from users who were distracted away from your store. When a visitor is about to leave your site, our app helps bring them back to complete their purchase.

## Try it out!

You can install Come Back Reminder directly from the [Shopify App Store]({APPS.comeBackReminder.storeUrl}).

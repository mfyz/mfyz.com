Diagrams are fantastic tools for explaining complex systems. They act as a visual map, allowing viewers to grasp how various components interact and connect in a single glance.

However, static diagrams sometimes lack the ability to convey intricate processes fully. Imagine presenting a complex system diagram – you can narrate, draw focus to specific elements, and guide your audience through the visual representation. However one of the primary goals of diagrams is to provide a clear explanation without needing a constant narration.

Animating diagrams, particularly the flow between different components, bridges the gap between static images and detailed narration. Animations act as a visual guide, directing viewers' attention and highlighting the order of operations within the system.

Imagine seeing a building’s piping system statically on paper (which is still an amazing way to give information about, well the piping in a building).

But imagine the drawing animates and shows the direction of the flow of water or sewer system. Increasing the information signal using animations, amplifies the impact of the system diagram.

I recently ended up using [Drawing.io](http://Drawing.io) that has easy way to do this.

Most of the time the connections between components of the diagrams are the pieces we want to animate.

I looked for this in a lot of other tools I used in the past. Both proper diagramming tools like lucid charts, mermaid, excalidraw, and miro. figma/figjam and general presentation apps like Keynote, and PowerPoint. None have easy animation options.

The way I started doing easy animations, is to use my existing drawings, import them as static jpeg/png or SVG into [draw.io](http://draw.io) then draw a connector line over my existing lines, give it a white color and make it thick, then check it’s “animation” option to animate white dashes lines that animate over my existing connector lines, making them animated.

Beyond Animation, I like [draw.io](http://draw.io) because **i**t's a fantastic drawing tool. It’s open-source and free to use and contribute to. Works cross-platform. It has a lot of drawing elements, and you can import your own png, svg icons to your library.

You can install [draw.io](http://draw.io) on your desktop (on Mac, using homebrew, as simple as brew install --cask drawio), use the online version for free, or signup for cloud plans to collaborate with your team.

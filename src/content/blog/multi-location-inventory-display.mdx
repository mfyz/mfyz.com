Running a Shopify store with multiple fulfillment centers? Here's a common challenge: your inventory might be stocked across various locations, but your shoppers only see a single, blended number. That confusion? It leads to slower sales and higher support costs.

### ‚ùå Shopify's Default Inventory Display Falls Short

Shopify aggregates inventory across all locations by default. But shoppers care *where* their item is coming from‚Äîespecially when shipping time matters.

Say a customer in LA buys something, not realizing it ships from NYC. That means delays, frustration, and potential cancellations.

If you're trying to:
- Show **location-based availability**
- Highlight **in-store pickup** options
- Communicate **faster shipping zones**

Then you need a smarter solution.

### ‚ú® Enter: Inventory Stock Status

The [**Inventory Stock Status**](https://apps.shopify.com/inventory-stock-status) app makes it easy to display inventory per warehouse or fulfillment center‚Äîright on your product detail pages.

/>

#### üß© Customize Everything:

- Show or hide **location names**
- Sort locations by **most in stock**, **nearest**, or custom order
- Display **Low Stock** thresholds with rich text (add emojis, buttons, and more!)
- Auto-hide out-of-stock locations

### üåç Tailored for Global Stores

Running a store with warehouses in Europe, the US, or APAC? You can translate each label by language and only show the relevant locations.

Perfect for:
- Brands with **international fulfillment**
- Stores offering **regional pickup**
- Retailers using **multi-language storefronts**

### üöÄ More Trust = More Conversions

Location-based stock info isn't just a nice-to-have. It builds **trust**, sets **clear delivery expectations**, and **reduces WISMO tickets** ("Where is my order?").

Let your inventory do more than just exist‚Äîlet it sell.

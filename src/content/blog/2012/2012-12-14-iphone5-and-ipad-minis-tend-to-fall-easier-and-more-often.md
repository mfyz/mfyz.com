I dropped my iPad mini this morning, it somehow flipped in my hands, fell and kissed the floor from the back side. I did similar with my MacBook pro 5-6 years ago, just a week after I bought it. That's the only device I dropped until now. ![](/images/archive/en/2020/05/cracked-iphone_pirlwt.jpg?fit=550%2C367&ssl=1) I am usually very careful with my mobile devices but except this last incident, I never dropped my stuff. I've been using my iPhone 5 and I dropped it 3 times in the first week. I got my iPad mini last month and it also is lighter and thinner than they were. I commute using the subway on a daily basis and I usually read on my iPad, I wasn't carrying my regular iPad but I started to have the new one almost every day. I use a crowded subway line in the mornings and this morning, I was hustling with the crowd to get in and after I got in, I was stabilizing my position and somehow iPad flipped in my hands and I dropped it. It was between stress moment and playing cool :) Nothing happened anyway. We used to have heavy devices usually and after last ones, I still couldn't get used to hold them. But it's obvious that these lighter and smaller devices tend to fall more easily and often. I see cracked screens everyday. Probably screen replacement become cheaper and easier and there are more companies providing these services, i'm assuming this is the case, even if it isn't, it will be soon.

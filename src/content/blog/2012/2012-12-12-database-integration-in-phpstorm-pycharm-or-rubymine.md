JetNrains released better database integration to their IDEs which applies to PhpStorm, PyCharm and RubyMine. They had database integration with some level of functionality but recently they released a video with their latest updates which is included in this post. I didn't use database integration before in PHPStorm but i tried after seeing this video and i found it very productive and helpful. After installing Java connectors (which you can do it with no extra effort) you'll be good to go for connecting your database with many different database engines in your project. With database integration, you can review the structure of your database, access and manage your data and develop your SQLs with lots of cool features. These stuff are pretty standard so far, almost like a replacement of PHPMyAdmin. Nothing very new. I found a particular connection between my code and my database very helpful, and that is, you can develop your SQL while you write your code, or you can test and run your SQL from your code without touching, copy/pasting. Also it does code IntelliSense while you write yourSQL which saves some time from mistypes and makes sql development more fun. Check this video out for feature tour: Source: http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2012/11/sql-support-and-database-tools/

Hello fellows,

This is the introduction letter of my website's English version. I've been writing articles/tutorials and sharing my development experiences with a local group of web developers under this domain since 2002. I got covered some of the well known and modern (at least all of them were modern when they were written :) ) for common web development problems and techniques.

Anyway, now I'm starting to write all in English beside Turkish. You can switch between Turkish and English versions of the articles if there are linked articles in both languages.

You can also check out my portfolio [http://mfyz.net](http://mfyz.net)

Cheers to all techy geeks :)

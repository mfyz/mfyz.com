## 1. TRANSITION ANIMATIONS

**IMPORTANT**: Preserve the transition animations for cover images
- CoverImage.astro must include transition:name={slug} on the Image component
- This enables the zoom animation when navigating between:
  - Blog list and blog detail pages
  - App list and app detail pages
- Do not remove this attribute in future edits

## 2. TYPOGRAPHY

**IMPORTANT**: Maintain Georgia font for headings
- tailwind.config.mjs: fontFamily.secondary must be ["Georgia", "serif"]
- This provides the distinct serif typography for all headings
- global.css should keep h1-h6 with font-secondary and font-normal classes
- BlogPost.astro uses prose-headings:font-secondary prose-headings:font-normal

## 3. OTHER VISUAL ELEMENTS

- Preserve hover animations (scale-105) on images
- Maintain the dark mode implementation
- Keep the consistent color scheme defined in global.css

These elements are core to the site's visual identity and user experience.
Please consult with Fatih before changing any of these design patterns.

## 4. COMPONENT USAGE GUIDELINES

- For all images prefer Image astro component, instead of <img> tag
- For images that are larger than 700px width, use ImageZoom component
- For Q&A style content, especially if multiple next to each other, prefer using CollapsibleText
  (Don't use CollapsibleText if it's just a single piece of content)
- For YouTube links in content, prefer using YouTube component which shows the video as embed
